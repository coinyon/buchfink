# Buchfink - Plaintext Crypto Portfolio

![Tests](https://github.com/coinyon/buchfink/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Buchfink is a commandline application that you can use for keeping book over
your crypto trades and generate profit/loss statements and tax reports.

Under the hood, Buchfink uses algorithms and data structures from
[Rotki](https://github.com/rotki/rotki), the open source portfolio tracker. But
instead of a GUI, user accounts and an encrypted database, Buchfink uses a
CLI and plain text files for declarative configuration and storage.

Note: Buchfink is early alpha. Do NOT use it for tax or trading purposes.
But feel free to report bugs and missing features.
